## Welcome

By the end of this section you should have a fully operational omnichannel contact center. Inbound voice, SMS, chat and email will be routed to your user and you will be able to accept and answer interactions. 

> This part of the workshop is focused on teaching you how to test the following interaction channels: voice, chat, email and SMS to ensure they are being routed correctly.
