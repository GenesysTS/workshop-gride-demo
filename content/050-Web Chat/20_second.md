## Test a Chat Interaction

1. As mentioned, using the Genesys Demo Extension tool allows customers to envision what an interaction widget may look like on their website. The tool will work on the majority of webistes, but for todays demo lets use Genesys.com 

2. Once on the website, click the extension tool icon on your toolbar. Click both **Start Inspecting** & **Start Injecting**. You'll now notice a clickable popout on the top-right of the page. From here we can initiate a web chat. Keep in mind we can add the ability kick off other interaction types with the same widget, but for this module we'll focus on web chat.

3. Once the icon is selected, the chat window appears on the bottom-left. The fields presented are configurable, but for today lets just add our first name and last name. Before clicking **Start Chat**, ensure your agent on the Genesys Cloud CX platform is set to the "On-Queue" status. Now begin the chat.
