## Voice Troubleshooting
 If voice interactions are not being routed to the correct agent/queue or are not appearing in the interaction pane, please walk through the following troubleshooting tips:

* [Confirm agent is a member of the queue that was created at the beginning of the workshop](https://genesys-samples.github.io/gride-demo/020-settinguptheinteractions/10_first.html#queues)

* [Confirm calling number is tied to flow](https://genesys-samples.github.io/gride-demo/020-settinguptheinteractions/10_first.html#follow-along)

* [Confirm agent status is set to "On-Queue"](https://genesys-samples.github.io/gride-demo/030-testinteractions/10_first.html#test-an-incoming-voice-interaction)

 If interactions are still not being routed correctly, please reach out to Veronica Guevara at veronica.guevara@genesys.com.
