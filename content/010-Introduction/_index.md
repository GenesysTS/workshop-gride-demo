# Dev Lab Setup
![Title](/images/title2.jpg)
## Objective

This workshop is intended to take you from activating your Dev Lab to answering your first call . You will learn what tools agents have at their disposal when handling the interactions and how to best leverage those tools. 



**Notes before you start**:
* It is recommended to use search functionality in the admin panel vs. manually trying to navigate to any of the admin sections (Please see image below)
![Search](/images/gcadmin.png)

* It is highly recommended to use naming conventions when creating any items (other than location, site, and base settings) to ensure you are not developing over colleague deployments. Ex: JaneDoe_Queue or JaneDoe_Inboundflow, etc

**Activating Your Account**
1. ## Open your welcome email and click the link to activate the account. 
- The link will navigate you to the initial account creation screen requesting company  name, email and password for the initial account. It is recommended that you enter in a shared account for this initial setup, instead of a personal account, to simplify recovery for future users

2. ## Admin > Genesys Add Ons > Find the Genesys Cloud Voice Tile and ensure it is active
![Activate ](/images/activate.jpg)

- This should be enabled by default, however non GCV org orders will require manual activation <br>
- If activation is required, select the tile and activate GCV- this can take around 10 minutes to fully activate

Note: You may need to skip and come back to "Ensuring Genesys Cloud Voice is Activated" as making sure the proper roles and permissions have been assigned to the user may need to be accomplished first
