## Manual Outbound Interactions

1. You now have, at least, two-three interactions connected, and you're learning the basics of an omnichannel experience. We're going to throw one more interaction type into the mix. On the phone call, the customer requests that the contact center agent sends out a text message with specific information, such as a retail address, for them to quickly access. 

2. To complete this request, you need to go into the interaction pane and next to the conversations heading, there will be a "+" icon next to a human outline.This icon allows an agent to start a new [call](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/place-a-call-on-behalf-of-a-queue/) or [email[](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/send-outbound-email-behalf-queue/) on behalf of a queue with a customer. We also have another option to [effortlessly start interactions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/switch-channels-for-an-interaction/) too.

3. When you click the plus icon, you will be presented with options to start a new conversation:

    Click "Send Message," choose the "G Ride" Queue and add input the ten-digit phone number that you'd like to text. You should pull the same Ani that is being used on the voice call, if possible. When ready, hit the green icon to start the SMS interaction.

4. Either input manually a message to send out or utilize another canned response. When finished, close out and end the interactions (part of the interaction tools). Each one will prompt you for the appropriate after-call work and wrap-up that you created.

5. Once you have completed this, you have finished the scenario and module and have successfully learned the basics of the Genesys Cloud CX Omnichannel Agent Interaction Experience. 

    To note, this is just the introduction of the Genesys Cloud CX Interactions. There are more interaction types such as social media and third-party interactions that we have not covered.
