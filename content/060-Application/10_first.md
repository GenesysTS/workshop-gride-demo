## Let's get ready

1. Step One: Go to the top right corner of the Genesys Cloud CX application (either browser or desktop) and toggle the on-queue switch to on. This turns the user's status to on-queue and available for routing interactions in all queues that the user is active in.

2. Step Two: You need to do two things to ensure you're ready to start receiving interactions: 

     Go to the user profile in the top left corner, and verify: (1) you have a phone/endpoint selected (this will typically be webRTC) and (2) hit the activate queues button and ensure you're activated in the queue you created. Please reference the picture below.

3. Step Three: Move to the interaction screen and we're ready to start walking through the scenarios.
