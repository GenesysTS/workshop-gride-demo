## Welcome


The purpose of this scenario is to showcase the tools that agents utilize during interactions. Multiple, disparate systems for voice, mobile, web chat, self-service, social media, CRM, etc., each with their own user interface, makes it difficult for contact centre agents to deliver effortless customer service. Genesys delivers an integrated, omnichannel experience to ensure agents have full insight into customer information and can deliver a personalized customer experience.
